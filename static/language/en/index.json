The open source platform that turns law into software.
Getting started 
Everything you can do with OpenFisca!
Economists & researchers
OpenFisca allows you to use survey data to simulate the impact of a reform on a given government’s budget and on a population’s standard of living.
Innovation teams & developers
OpenFisca allows you to easily create web applications based on your simulation results, thanks to the web API. You can build a great variety of other services by coding formulas, hosting your own instance or building your own extensions
Public administration
OpenFisca allows you to stop building your micro-simulation software and tax & benefit calculators on your own. Instead, contribute to OpenFisca, collaborate with other administrations and reduce the bill for the taxpayer.
