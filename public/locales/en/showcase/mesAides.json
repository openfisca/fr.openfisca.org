Mes Aides is a social benefits simulator.

Built by BetaGouv, the French government innovation team.
Mes Aides informs French citizens on their eligibility to national and local social benefits. In less than 7 minutes, the service gives an answer on more than 30 benefits.  

Mes Aides also designed some custom-made extensions such as city local benefits or tools to trace the calculation details and navigate through it.
